Simulated Space Colonies across the Web
---------------------------------------

Have your humans dispersed to the far reaches of the galaxy? Do their myriad civilizations need names and descriptions? diaspora is a web service and library for procedurally generating descriptions of space colonies. It was built for PROCJAM 2014: [itch.io/jam/procjam](http://itch.io/jam/procjam)

Usage
-----

* Generate space colonies, one at a time, from your browser: [diaspora-colonies.herokuapp.com]( http://diaspora-colonies.herokuapp.com )

OR

* Generate space colonies in JSON, several at a time, with the API. Specify the number of colonies with a simple query string: [diaspora-colonies.herokuapp.com/api/v1.0/?10](http://diaspora-colonies.herokuapp.com/api/v1.0/?10)

OR

* Write a python program and include the Colony.py module

The Future?
-----------

Consider the possibility of future enhancements:
* More attributes
* POST colony attributes to seed the descriptions  
* Evolving colonies that redescribe themselves
